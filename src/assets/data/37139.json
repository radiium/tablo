It could be anything. The jingling of little bells perhaps, or the tiny flickering out of tiny lives.

A place where nothing happens.","subTitle":"","medium":"Six-channel video (black and white and color, sound), aluminum, Plexiglas, neon","dimensions":"Dimensions and duration variable","medias":{"mini":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjE5NTUzNiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDMwMHgzMDBcdTAwM2UiXV0.jpg?sha=c535934350695590","medium":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjE5NTUzNiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDMwMHgzMDBcdTAwM2UiXV0.jpg?sha=c535934350695590","max":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjE5NTUzNiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=149446b74a2aa6a3","page":"http://www.moma.org/collection/works/131032"},"classification":"Media and Performance","credits":"Gift of Maja Hoffmann and of Franz Wassmer"}
