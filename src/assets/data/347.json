Except, of course, that it is a fake; first by the simple fact of being built in Manhattan, at the turn of the century. But the stone work is re-inforced with steel which is expanding with rust. Someday it will destroy the stone. The Cathedral is in Morningside Heights overlooking a panoramic view of Harlem which is separated by a high fence.","subTitle":"","medium":"Moose skull with antler, metal pipe, wood, and paint","dimensions":"96 x 60 x 54\" (243.8 x 152.4 x 137.2 cm)","medias":{"mini":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjMwMjM4NyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDMwMHgzMDBcdTAwM2UiXV0.jpg?sha=b6c3586fa9d046f9","medium":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjMwMjM4NyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDMwMHgzMDBcdTAwM2UiXV0.jpg?sha=b6c3586fa9d046f9","max":"http://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjMwMjM4NyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=bc4ad197868aea99","page":"http://www.moma.org/collection/works/166075"},"classification":"Painting & Sculpture","credits":"Committee on Painting and Sculpture Funds"}
